<div class="product-single__description rte" itemprop="description"><p><b></b><span style="--weight:400">Our educational kit is a powerful platform
for prototyping ideas using cardboard and electronics. The Robot In A Can is
a highly effective pedagogical toolkit that values fostering creativity and
self-expression. This tool gives you the power to repurpose raw household
recycled items and bring them to life with the power of creativity,
electronics, and programming! Transform a milk carton into a precision
driving robot; Make a piece of cardboard into your own musical instrument;
turn old soda bottles into an automated plant growing system; modify a tea
mug to tell you if your drink is too hot; use your imagination and
prototype! To get you started you can build our signature MilkBot and
CubeBot robots with the cardboard that comes in the can. Try different
experiments and tutorials to build your skill. This kit is suitable for ages
8+, but can be used by experts alike.</span></p><p><b>Our skill-building curriculum incorporates three major components:</b></p><ol><li style="--weight:400"><span style="--weight:400">Computer
Programming</span></li><li style="--weight:400"><span style="--weight:400">Wiring and Electronic
Circuitry</span></li><li style="--weight:400"><span style="--weight:400">Design Thinking and
Rapid Prototyping</span></li></ol><p><span style="--weight:400">Our signature MilkBot and CubeBot robots both come
inside the can.</span></p><p><span style="--weight:400">Our innovative and unique system is quick and easy
to set up. Turn the kit on and you can start programming in less than a
minute without any difficult driver installation or software setup. The main
component of the kit is our custom WiFi microcontroller board. It can be
programmed and controlled by a phone, tablet or laptop. Using our
easy-to-use, open-source, browser-based, drag-and-drop coding system. Any
device that can run Google Chrome will work with our kits to help learners
get started with microcontroller programming. Our computer chip has a unique
wiring system so you can learn to build circuits. Unlike most beginner kits
our design is flexible allowing you to do more projects with the same
kit.</span></p><h1></h1><p><span style="--weight:400">Our kits are designed to be a rugged all-in-one
solution for use in classrooms. With minimal small parts, it&rsquo;s quick to set
up and clean up. Learning doesn&rsquo;t stop in the classroom, resources are
available online so you can continue projects at home! This raw DIY platform
teaches beginners real foundational skills while building confidence and
encouraging creativity. The</span><span style="--weight:400">microcomputer is also fully hackable and can be used by advanced users who
want more control.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>A few projects straight out of the CAN:</b></p><ul><li style="--weight:400"><span style="--weight:400">Custom

it&rsquo;s easy to find new projects and experiment. Our learners can stretch
their creativity and can exercise the intuition crucial to being a
successful designer. Through our magazine-guidebook or online you can follow
our illustrations, videos, and graphic novel segments to learn with our
robotic project recipes. The online learning portal allows users to share
their ideas in our online community.</span></p></div>
