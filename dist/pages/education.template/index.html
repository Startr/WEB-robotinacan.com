                <p class="lead">At Robot in a Can, our fundamental goal is to give learners access to engaging, low-cost
                    and easy-to-navigate tools that will make Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics
                    (STEAM) education inspiring and approachable.</p>
                <p>Our activities are designed to encourage students to explore and develop skills through an
                    integration of important concepts with exercises with real-world context.<br /><br />At the center
                    of
                    our ecosystem is the robotics kit (link to product page here). To complement it, we offer a wide
                    range of services from short demonstrations to a 40-week curriculum to professional development.</p>

                <p><b>School visits</b></p>
                <p>Through in-class or after-school programs, we guide learners on how to use our kit and apply it to
                    numerous individual and collaborative projects with different learning outcomes and scientific
                    principles. The duration of our programs range from 4 to 40 weeks.</p>
                <p><b>Show and tell</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:400">We visit and set up shop in your learning institution, library or any
                        other venue. We bring with us all the necessary equipment to create interactive and engaging
                        demonstrations of projects and ideas.</span></p>
                <p><b>Maker Camp</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:400">We run a summer day-camp where youth learn about fundamental concepts
                        to develop robotics projects and use our robotics kit to implement these concepts. Learners
                        design, construct, present and take apart their creations. The duration of our camp varies
                        according to your needs and constraints.</span></p>
                <p><b>Educational Kits</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:400">We provide a bundle of educational materials and tools for educators to
                        teach foundational principles in coding, electronics and robotics. Let your learners and
                        attendees experience and take home something unique and memorable!</span></p>
                <p><b>Professional Development</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:400">We provide educators with guided, interactive sessions where we explore
                        the concepts, approaches and reasons to integrate STEAM in activities in and outside the
                        classroom. We develop our programs aligned with validated educational standards and approaches,
                        and strive to provide reusable and flexible materials educators can adapt and adopt for
                        themselves and their learners.</span></p>
                <p><b>Events &amp; Community Collaboration</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:400">We work from our own little Makerspace in Montreal and are very
                        involved with the community. Contact us (link to contact page) and we can collaborate! We
                        participate in Maker, engineering, education, digital art, and robotics events. For larger
                        events, we can lead staff training to offer a unique experience to your attendees or we can
                        bring our own staff to host programming.</span></p><a id="kits" name="kits"></a>
