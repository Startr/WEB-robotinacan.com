### What Can I Make With A Micro Controller?

Microcontrollers are at the heart of many consumer products, and other computer automated DIY Projects. The Robot In A Can WiFi microcontroller is called the EveLab and it can be used in a wide variety of applications! You will need to put it together and program it to become the project you have in mind.

There are so many different ways to make things using materials you can find almost anywhere. Or you can even practice the art of sourcing rare parts to build your specialized projects.

### Get familiar with what, and how people are making!

These websites are full of tutorials on how to use certain technologies in your projects, and complete project builds with step-by-step instructions. People have made all kinds of things for all types of purposes and posted them on the web for you to follow. I recommend looking through these websites when you need inspiration or are looking to figure out how you might want to solve a design challenge.
